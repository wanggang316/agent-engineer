Learn the fundamentals of AI agents and how to build them with Google Cloud AI.

## Who is this for?

Software engineers who want to understand what AI agents are, how they work, and how to build them. No prior AI/ML experience required - just curiosity and some Python knowledge.

## Course overview

This course is split into three parts:

**Part 1: Fundamentals (101)** - Understand the core concepts behind AI agents. These lessons are platform-agnostic and focused on building your mental model.

**Part 2: Building and shipping (201)** - Put those fundamentals into practice using Google Cloud AI, Vertex AI, and the Agent Development Kit (ADK).

**Part 3: Deep dives (301)** - Go deeper on specific topics that matter for real-world agent development.

## Lessons

### Part 1: fundamentals

| # | Lesson | What you will learn |
|---|--------|-------------------|
| 01 | [What are AI agents?](/01-what-are-ai-agents/) | The big picture - what agents are, why they matter, and when to use them |
| 02 | [How agents think](/02-how-agents-think/) | LLMs as the reasoning engine - how models plan, decide, and generate |
| 03 | [Tools - giving agents hands](/03-tools-giving-agents-hands/) | Function calling, tool design, and connecting agents to the real world |
| 04 | [Agentic design patterns](/04-agentic-design-patterns/) | ReAct, reflection, planning, and other core patterns |
| 05 | [Memory and context](/05-memory-and-context/) | How agents remember things - sessions, context windows, and long-term memory |
| 06 | [Planning and reasoning](/06-planning-and-reasoning/) | How agents break down complex tasks and make decisions |
| 07 | [Multi-agent systems](/07-multi-agent-systems/) | When one agent is not enough - coordination, delegation, and teamwork |
| 08 | [Agentic RAG](/08-agentic-rag/) | Going beyond basic retrieval - agents that search, evaluate, and refine |
| 09 | [Evaluating and testing agents](/09-evaluating-and-testing-agents/) | How to know if your agent actually works - metrics, evals, and observability |
| 10 | [Guardrails and safety](/10-guardrails-and-safety/) | Keeping agents trustworthy - security, alignment, and responsible AI |

### Part 2: building and shipping

| # | Lesson | What you will learn |
|---|--------|-------------------|
| 11 | [From prototype to production](/11-from-prototype-to-production/) | The journey from demo to deployed - CI/CD, rollout, and operations |
| 12 | [Getting started with Vertex AI and ADK](/12-getting-started-with-vertex-and-adk/) | The Google Cloud AI stack for agents - what is available and how it fits together |
| 13 | [Building your first agent](/13-building-your-first-agent/) | Hands-on - build a working agent with ADK step by step |
| 14 | [Agent protocols - MCP and A2A](/14-agent-protocols-mcp-and-a2a/) | How agents talk to tools and to each other using open standards |

### Part 3: deep dives

| # | Lesson | What you will learn |
|---|--------|-------------------|
| 15 | [AGENTS.md](/15-agents-md/) | Giving AI coding agents context about your project with a standard config file |
| 16 | [MCP deep dive](/16-mcp-deep-dive/) | How MCP works under the hood, MCP vs. CLI tools, and security considerations |
| 17 | [Agent skills](/17-agent-skills/) | Packaging reusable domain expertise as portable skill modules |
| 18 | [Orchestrators](/18-orchestrators/) | Managing agent control flow - patterns, frameworks, and best practices |
| 19 | [Where to go from here](/19-where-to-go-from-here/) | Resources, codelabs, community, and next steps |

## How to use this course

- **Read in order** if you are new to agents. Each lesson builds on the previous one.
- **Jump around** if you already know the basics. Each lesson is self-contained enough to read on its own.
- **Follow the links** to official docs, codelabs, and tutorials for hands-on practice. We intentionally link out to maintained resources rather than duplicating API docs or code samples that go stale.

## Philosophy

This course follows a few principles:

- **Analogies first.** We use everyday comparisons to explain complex concepts before diving into technical details.
- **Fundamentals over frameworks.** Understand the "why" before the "how." Frameworks change, but the core ideas stick around.
- **Link, don't duplicate.** For API references, code samples, and setup instructions, we point to official Google Cloud docs and codelabs. This keeps our content focused on concepts and ensures you always see up-to-date information.
- **Honest about trade-offs.** Every architectural choice has costs. We try to show both sides.

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python knowledge (functions, classes, HTTP requests)
- A Google Cloud account ([free trial available](https://cloud.google.com/free))
- Familiarity with REST APIs and JSON
